🎬 YouTube Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a YouTube Clone UI built using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on recreating the visual layout and user interface of the original YouTube website. The goal of this project is to strengthen front-end fundamentals and understand how real-world websites are structured and styled.

The clone includes a responsive header with a search bar, sidebar navigation similar to YouTube, and a video grid layout that displays video thumbnails, titles, channel information, and view details. Special attention has been given to spacing, alignment, typography, and hover effects to closely match the original design.

This project does not include backend functionality or JavaScript logic. All components are static and designed purely for UI/UX practice.
